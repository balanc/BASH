					<h2>Dear Bash</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>I need to profess it now—I love you. There, I have said it simply. My love is laid out, open, naked, and all the more vulnerable because of it, but I need to tell you. Even if you cannot accept it, I want you to know.</p>

				<p>I cannot tell you enough about how much I appreciate what you do for me. Before meeting you, I was clouded with a dark loneliness as I treaded through daily tasks mouse in one hand and keyboard in the other. I was constantly shifting, but the progress was always slow, sometimes even regrettable. I could only hope that trusting in myself would get me through it all. Looking back, I see how weary I had become of the monotony, the mistakes, the lost time. I was losing myself completely.</p>

				<p>Admittedly, I feared the change to you at first. Your simplicity, a blank slate, a clean innocuous surface, masks just how powerful and reliable you are. All that you ever want from me is a command and an argument separated by a space. You give me the option to do different things with the same command so long as I put a dash and letter between the command and argument. You even let me take shortcuts to ease the pain of typing everything out. Pressing up gives me my previous commands. Using Tab autocompletes names if they are there. It’s a bit cut-and-dry, but it is simple and I love it.</p>

				<p>Everything I have ever needed and more, you offer so much to me, but never ask anything in return. You go so far as to explain each command with “man &lt;topic&gt;”. These manual pages you give me are priceless, though quite long sometimes. Thank you for  letting me know I can go forward and back with “f” or “b” like turning a page and simply pressing “q” to leave it. I am sorry for forgetting commands sometimes. You never get angry about it. You are always willing to help find it with “man -k &lt;keyword&gt;” or “apropos &lt;keyword&gt;”. I will be better about it. Not just for me, but for the both of us. I want to work with you, be with you.</p>

				<p>The way you let me easily and simply create, move, remove, and copy files and directories gets me all hot and bothered. Never again do I want to go back to painstaking menu-searching and shifting between keyboard and mouse. Playing in this sunny field of incredibly fast, abbreviated commands you offer is unbelievably exciting. Nothing will ever replace you.</p>

				<p>I remember the first command I have ever used was “echo Hello World!“. My heart skipped a beat at your response. At that very moment, I knew you meant something more to me, but I did not imagine how much I could crave this feeling of love for you. Learning more about you just fuels my desire to be with you. Just as I learned to list all of the files and directories with “ls” and options like “-l” for long-form, “-a” for all, and “h” to see sizes, I kept wanting to explore more. Remember how I struggled making new directories with “mkdir &lt;name&gt;”? Slowly I got it with your help. I have even experimented with making a whole list of directories at one time with the “-p” option like this, “mkdir -p directory1/directory2/directory3/directory4/”. It has saved me so much time. Thank you. My mind and soul is now brimming with the thought of you and I would not have it any other way.</p>

				<p>Using “pwd” shows me which directory I am in, right? And if I use “cd” to change directories, “..” let’s me move up a parent directory, “~” sends me to my home directory, “-” toggles to the previous directory if I remember correctly. Oh, and so long as I just type directory names like “directory1/directory2/” it is always a relative path from my current directory. Using the “/” at the start is an absolute path from the root. It’s such a simple, but powerful distinction. Creating, moving, removing, and copying files or directories work kind of like “cd”, right? I just use “touch &lt;filename.extension&gt;” to create,  “mv &lt;file.extension&gt; &lt;directory1/file.extension&gt;” to move, “rm &lt;filename.extension&gt;” for remove, and “cp &lt;filename.extension&gt; &lt;directory1/filename.extension&gt;” to copy the file I want from one place to another. Again, thank you for keeping it simple for me.</p>

				<p>It is undeniably scary just how committed you are with carrying out my commands with no questions asked. If I just add the -R option to rm like in “rm -R &lt;directory/&gt;”, you absolutely will delete every file and the directory itself. Like an untouched mountainous landscape, powerful and almost unforgiving, truly sublime. The only reprieve from such danger is adding your simple, humble “-i” option with remove. Having this option to talk with each other and let me confirm in deleting something only adds to the excitement in sharing such a destructive power. But, really, let us not go there again unless we need to.</p>

				<p>Getting to read files with you has taken off such a burden to find and start up programs just to simply read something. You let me easily check the first couple of lines from the beginning or end of a file with “head &lt;filename.extension&gt;” or tail &lt;filename.extension&gt;” just to see if it is the right one before opening it. When I do find it, it is so amazing that “cat &lt;filename1.extension&gt; &lt;filename2.extension&gt;” lets me read multiple files at one time so quickly. The “less” is “more” humor made my day. It really is useful for longer files because I can go forward and back through the text. If I ever needed to change anything, you readily present me with multiple editors each with its own quirks like “ed”, “nano”, “vi”, and “emacs”. Thank you for letting me know that “Control or Command + C” quits most commands. Sometimes I get stuck.</p>

				<p>I still cannot thank you enough for everything you do, especially protecting my files with “chmod &lt;mode&gt; &lt;filename.extension&gt;” by changing read “r”, write “w”, and execute “x” permissions for everyone. It looks kind of confusing at first glance using list with options “ls -la”, but those letters at the beginning tell a lot. “drwxr-xr-x” is supposed to mean that the directory “d” can be read, written, and executed by me, but assigned groups “g” and everyone  else “o” are only allowed to read and execute the directory, right? If I just tell you “chmod go-rx &lt;directory/&gt;”, this removes all permissions for everyone, but me to keep everything private. What would I have done without you?</p>
